Benchmarking this change, I found no evidence that it affects
performance (when also including the later change to remove the result
return value). When marking decode_lpc_high_order with #[cold], I found
no evidence that that had any impact either. When marking
decode_lpc_low_order with #[inline(always)], that caused a severe
regression, from ~13 ns per sample to ~16 ns per sample.

Measured mean time per sample over all samples (time per sample for each
block is the minimum over 140 runs, for 18k blocks from 5 different
files).

Before LPC fix: 13.484 ± 0.018 ns
After LPC fix:  13.480 ± 0.018 ns
